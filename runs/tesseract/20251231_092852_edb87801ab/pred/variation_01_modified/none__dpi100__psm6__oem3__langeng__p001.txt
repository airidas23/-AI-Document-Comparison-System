Synthetic PDF baseline

Synthetic PDF Dataset Generation This document serves as a base template for generating synthetic PDF
pairs with known differences. The generator applies various modifications including text changes, formatting
adjustments, and structural alterations. Text Modifications The system can apply synonym swaps,
paraphrasing, typo insertion, and punctuation changes.
‘These modifications test the ability to detect subtle content differences while maintaining document structure.
Formatting Changes Font size adjustments and spacing modifications are applied to test formatting-aware
comparison. These changes simulate real-world scenarios where documents are reformatted without altering
content.
Structural Modifications Table structure changes figure caption updates, and header/footer modifications
provide comprehensive test cases for layout-aware diff detection. Each variation includes ground truth
annotations.
Extended Content Section This page demonstrates how the generator handles multi-page documents.
Paragraphs are distributed across pages, and modifications can occur on any page. The evaluation framework
uses these synthetic pairs to measure detection accuracy, false positive rates, and the ability to correctly
classify different types of changes.
